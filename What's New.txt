  application.
- Fix: Tile help for one-ways had a typeo.
- I have included tiles.h and level.h from MulgIIh, so .LEV files import and export
  will work correctly.

  open door.
- "Thank you"s for the bug reports must go to :
  * Rick Lastrapes

Version 2.0 (May 2000):
- Happy birthday to MulgEd ! One year has passed since the first release !
- MulgEd just got platform independent (no MS-extentions).
- Bugfixes :
  - A level-drag lock after double-clicking on a level.
  - Editing a note in game editor did not update the note in the file.
- Improved the tile drawing functions. You'll notice that when you draw
  tiles, the program reacts much faster.
- Added the level coordinates in the status bar when moving with your mouse 
  over the level drawing board.
- All level and note actions are now in the menu only. There is no context-menu
  on the level and note lists.
- Parachute time is now limited to 60 seconds even though Mulg allows up to 127.

Version 1.5j Preview 3 (March 2000):
- Level re-ordering (drag-drop) is back and working.
- Game analysis dialog now gives you data about the whole game.
- Game file version sensitivity. For now only in game analysis. I'll embed 
  this feature in open/save sometime (levL vs. levF).
- Bug fix: Adding a level now causes it to be selected.
- Bug fix: Installing an empty game used to launch windows explorer.
- A what's new menu item (Help menu) shows this file.
- Connection of distant tiles by dragging the connection beyond the level 
  drawing board, thus causing it to scroll (Yes! This feature's here at last).
- Full support for the advanced Mulg IIh databases, with up to 256 levels and 
  up to 256 notes.
- Added a progress bar to the game editor for feedback on loading and saving 
  games, tiles, etc.
- Better error messages when importing bad .LEV files. Also better error
  handling.

Version 1.5j Preview 2 (March 2000):
- Support for four new "memo cube" tiles.
- You can now work with the Mulg color tiles (for the Palm IIIc).
- New tiles: icy reverser/un-reverser, box-in-place reverser/unreverser.
- Included palm installation of game files right from MulgEd (Game menu).
- Bug fix: Exporting games with scarab beatles and light boxes was throwing
  an exception.

Version 1.5j Preview 1 (February 2000):
- Re-programmed all of MulgEd in Java (with micro$oft extentions, sorry), as 
  a step towards platform independance.
- The level editor now shows "problems" in addition to general data, 
  along with the explanations.
- Undo-Redo in level editor (up to 50 steps back).
- Ability to add a note while working on connections.
- Fixed a lot of tiles' names to fit the names given by Mulg's authors.
- Fixed descending floors from x1..x4 to x0..x3.
- New editors for special tiles: 
  - Tiles that lie below others (scarab beatles, boxes).
  - Flip tiles: x and y channels (formerly known as B/W tiles).
  - Parachute time.
- All actions on levels and notes are performed by right-clicking on the lists.
- The level list also accepts keyboard input: Ins, Del, Enter, and arrow keys.
- Game import/export of .LEV files is now working. Just make sure you have the 
  included .h files in the same directory as the .LEV file when importing.
- Connection to the game-of-life channel is now easy. Right click on a channel 
  activator tile while working on connections, then connect to other tiles.
- Now supports up to 32 levels (for Mulg IIg and later).
- Old MulgEd game files are now detected and their dates are "n/a".

Version 1.5 Beta (January 2000):
- BIG version will be the standard from now on. Sorry, you wimpy 
  640x480 users ... buy a newer graphics card ;)
  The required size is about 650x500 to be exact.
- "Level properties" combined dialog instead of name and dimensions 
  dialogs (future level properties will be included here).
- Support for the new tiles by Pat E. Kane : 
  Light box, Switch space, Scarab beatle.
- Fixed tiles names and help texts.
- Fixed bug in level info - channel 0 was giving garbage results.
- Unfortunately, a 2D windows accelerator VGA card is required for 
  MulgEd. If you don't have such a card, editing mode other than 30x27
  will look distorted. This is due to the use of StretchBlt operation.
  As far as i know those cards are popular for years so hardly anyone
  will have a problem.
- Tiles are now divided to three tilesets. Standard, Additional and 
  Groove/Rampart to allow more tiles to fit in MulgEd.
- MulgEd now uses the Windows Registry to include an option to edit .
  Mulg games by right-clicking on their names, and always comes back
  to the directory you left it at. Also auto-install of this feature 
  is now implemented.
- Added those tiles you always waited for : 
  Heavy box in place, Light box in place, Un-reverser (!).
  4 types of descending floors (for x1..x4 passes).
- While browsing files, you can see the game name and number of levels.
- Creation time and modification time and count are now stored 
  correctly in the files, and are shown on the game editor screen.
  (old MulgEd created files will show either 21.10.2022,5:33:38 or 
   4.2.99:16:14:23)   :o
- Author name can only be changed in a newly created game. Also, a
  a game cannot be saved without an author name.

Version 1.41 (November 1999):
- Special BIG version of the level editor.
  This will not fit in a 640x480 screen, and will fill almost the 
  whole 800x600 screen, but it lets you edit 30x27 tiles at once.
- Fixed bug : when marks are shown, drawing tiles does not erase the 
  marks now.

Version 1.4 (November 1999):
- Umbrella timing (work with connections).
- Debug games (games that allow you to play all levels).
  These games will have (D) added to their names on the Palm.
- Level re-ordering using drag and drop.
- Better .PDB header manipulation
- Auto install does not open a DOS box now.
- No VCL version of MulgEd. Only the regular version is available 
  from now on.
- A what's new file is attached to each new version.
- Marking of edge tiles for ease of editing of medium and large levels.
- Even more minor bug fixes.

Version 1.3 (October 1999):
- Fixed tunnel and platform tileset bug.
- Wrap around test.
- New tile : Oil stain.
- No black color for connection circles.
- Quick image loading (images are included in the EXE file).

- New intuitive way of connecting tiles that work together.
- Intuitive note connection.
- Level integrity checking.
- More bug fixes.
- No need for Delphi's VCLs - bigger EXE file that runs on all 
  computers.

  Opened gates, Movable box, Starting point.
- Change aware program

Version 0.99 (April 1999):

Things that are yet to be fixed and added:
------------------------------------------
- Parachute time up to 127.
- 4 Tiles of scarab beatles in all directions, and all Hanoi tower tiles (total of 7)
  This will require a new tileset. What a joy !  ;)
